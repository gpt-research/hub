# @gpt-research/hub

🔬 Welcome to the GPT Research Hub!

This repository houses open-source model weights stemming from cutting-edge research projects. Our mission is to democratize access to advanced language models while ensuring responsible usage.

## Safety Concerns with Code Accessibility

⚠️ **Safety First!** ⚠️

The primary safety concern behind restricting access to certain components of CamelGPT lies in the potential misuse of the technology. Allowing open access to code that empowers the creation of powerful language models with minimal resources could lead to the generation of malicious content, misinformation, or other harmful applications. By controlling access to sensitive components, we aim to prevent such misuse and promote responsible AI development.

## Responsible Usage through Official Model Releases

🛡️ **Guardians of Responsibility** 🛡️

To ensure the responsible and ethical application of CamelGPT, we strongly encourage users to utilize official model releases provided by our team. These official model releases are thoroughly evaluated and adhere to safety guidelines, enabling users to harness the power of CamelGPT responsibly and without compromising safety.

## Embracing Democratization

🌐 **Empowering All Minds** 🌐

Our goal is to democratize access to state-of-the-art language models, fostering a community of innovators and creators who can push the boundaries of AI in a responsible manner.
